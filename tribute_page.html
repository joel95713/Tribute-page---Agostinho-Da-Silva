            Agostinho da Silva was a philosopher, poet, essayist, professor,
            philologist, pedagogue, and translator. His thought combined
            elements of pantheism, millenarianism, and an ethic of renunciation,
            affirming freedom as the most important quality of human beings. He
            is considered one of the most important Portuguese intellectuals of
            the 20th century. Among his extensive bibliography, his book “Sete
            Cartas a um Jovem Filósofo” (“Seven Letters to a Young
            Philosopher”), published in 1945, stands out. He also collaborated
            with several periodicals, including the magazines “57” and
            "Princípio".

            "Among words and ideas, I detest this one: tolerance. It's a word
            used by moral societies in the face of immorality. It's an idea of
            disdain; seeming celestial, it's diabolical; it's a cloak of
            contempt, with the added irony that many who wear it think they are
            adorned with rays of sunlight."
